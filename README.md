   expo prebuild
   ```

## 3. How to Execute the Solution

### Running Locally (Development Mode)
To start the project in development mode:
```sh
npm run dev
```
This will launch the Expo development server. Scan the QR code with an Expo Go app on your mobile device to preview the app.

### Building the Project
For production builds, use:
```sh
npm run build
```
This command runs `eas build --platform all`, which builds the app for both iOS and Android. Ensure you are logged in to Expo:
```sh
eas login
```

### Running on Web
To run the project in a web browser:
```sh
npm run build:web
```
Then, serve the build output:
```sh
npx serve ./dist
```

## 4. Additional Notes
- Make sure your Expo and EAS CLI versions are up to date.
- Check `.env` files for any required API keys or configurations.
- If using external dependencies, verify installation using `expo doctor`.

For further troubleshooting, refer to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).
